    <dd>You'll look, feel and function better.</dd><br>
    <dd>Fitness changed my life completely. As a teenager, I got out of shape, I lacked confidence and direction in life. Starting to work out was, is</dd><br>
    <dd>and always will be the best decision of my life!</dd><br>
    <dd>In this journey, I've had a lot of ups and downs, injuries, self doubt, social pressure and I had to make many tough choices and sacrifices.</dd><br>
    <dd>But would I go through all of it again?</dd> <br>
    <dd>In a heartbeat!</dd><br>
    <dd>May 30 2016 - The day is I started working out. This is how I looked before‚Ä¶</dd><br>

          <dd>Lost a total of 6 months due to Injury.</dd><br>
          <dd>Went from doctor to doctor, clueless as to why I couldn't recover. Physiotherapy didn't work, X-rays didn't show anything. The MRI later</dd><br>
          <dd>showed that I had bulging disc in my L3 region of the spine.</dd><br>
          <dd>During this time, I realised I had hypothyroidism all these years. That's why I got fat and that's what's slowing down my recovery. This was</dd><br>
          <dd>a hard pill to swallow.</dd>
          <dd>This was the lowest phase of my life.</dd><br>
          <dd>But this is the time that transformed me the most as a person. It's like they say ‚Äú Diamond is made under immense pressure‚Äù.</dd><br>
          <dd>I took this time to expand my knowledge, read books, do onine fitness certifications, rehab.</dd><br>
          <dd>22 Mar 2019 - The doctor cleared me to start training again.</dd><br>
          <dd>I put all my knowledge to use and this time around I appreciated the opportunity I had to train again. I was grateful. I was determined</dd><br>
          <dd>more than ever!</dd><br>
          <dd>Finally I recovered to be better than ever before! Infact, the injury was instrumental in my transformation as I mended my ways, started training better and</dd><br>
          <dd>respecting my body more!</dd><br>
          <dd>8 July 2019 - Started Athlean AX1 training program</dd><br>
